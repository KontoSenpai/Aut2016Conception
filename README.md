# Aut2016Conception

Repository of Blob Battle,
a 3 programmers game made during a video game conception class at University of Qu√©bec at Chicoutimi.

There's an executable file in the archive placed at the root.
The game is fully playable and required 2 controllers( we developped using Xbox 360 controller).

Controls are pretty simple :
	- Left Stick for movement
	- Right trigger for a stomp.
	
The goal of the game is to jump on the head of your opponent to win a best of 3 tournament.

Developpers on this project are :
- Jimmy Senechal
- Warren Benyahia
- Benjamin Urtado
